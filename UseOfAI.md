Use of AI

I subscribe to github Copilot, and make use of its autocompletion feature. It saves alot of time and keeps me from some repetition. It does really like to give me try-catch blocks, and since it's something I dont use often, I figured I should include them in the code.
I do not use the chat feature of this software.

CHATGPT queries
    The following are notable queries made to chatgpt. I also note the information I was looking for and any additional information I learned from the response. This should help ensure I'm using AI as a learning tool, not a homework completer

    I also used it alot to find out how to write certain things, or the name of a method I couldn't reacall off the top of my head.

   Can you help me understand why the variables and methods in this class are all static, and how it works?

Response
   Absolutely, let's break it down step by step. This `SimpleDataSource` class is a **utility class** that simplifies the process of connecting to a database in Java using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

   ---

   ## üîß Why are the variables and methods `static`?

   The key reason is that this class is designed as a **singleton-like utility** ‚Äî meaning:

   * You don't need to create an instance of `SimpleDataSource`.
   * All operations are performed via **class-level methods and variables**.

   This approach avoids repetitive instantiations and centralizes database connection logic.

   ### Static Variables

   ```java
   private static String url;
   private static String username;
   private static String password;
   ```

   These variables hold the configuration (URL, username, password) needed to create a database connection.

   * They're `static` because the configuration is **shared across all usages** of this class.
   * Once initialized, any code that calls `getConnection()` will use the same database settings.

   ### Static Methods

   ```java
   public static void init(String fileName)
   ```

   * This sets the configuration (reads from a `.properties` file) once, and stores it in the static variables.
   * It also loads the JDBC driver class using `Class.forName(driver)`.

   ```java
   public static Connection getConnection()
   ```

   * This method uses the static configuration variables to return a new `Connection` object using `DriverManager`.

   So overall:

   * The class is initialized once with `SimpleDataSource.init(...)`.
   * Then you can get database connections at any time using `SimpleDataSource.getConnection()`.

   ---

   ## üì¶ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

   Assume you have a properties file `database.properties`:

   ```properties
   jdbc.driver=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
   jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
   jdbc.username=root
   jdbc.password=secret
   ```

   ### 1. **Initialize the Data Source**

   ```java
   SimpleDataSource.init("database.properties");
   ```

   * Loads the properties file.
   * Sets the `url`, `username`, and `password`.
   * Loads the JDBC driver class (`Class.forName(...)`) ‚Äî required by some older JDBC drivers.

   ### 2. **Get a Connection**

   ```java
   Connection conn = SimpleDataSource.getConnection();
   ```

   * Uses the previously loaded config to get a `Connection` from `DriverManager`.

   ---

   ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

   * **Thread Safety**: This class is not thread-safe if `init()` is called multiple times. Normally, `init()` should be called once during application startup.
   * **Better Practice**: For larger applications, consider using connection pools (like HikariCP, Apache DBCP) rather than opening new connections each time.
   * **No Instance Allowed**: Since everything is static, you don‚Äôt need and **should not instantiate** `SimpleDataSource`.

   ## ‚úÖ Summary

   | Feature              | Why it's `static`                                 |
   | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
   | Configuration fields | Shared for the whole app (single source of truth) |
   | `init()` method      | Only needs to be run once to configure the class  |
   | `getConnection()`    | Accessible globally without instantiation         |

   This design is clean and simple for small applications or educational purposes, though in production systems you'd typically use a more robust connection pooling solution.

   Let me know if you want an example of using it with a real properties file or want to improve it further!

What I wanted to know
   I had wanted to understand how it was used in the code, and how I was supposed to use that class. I actually didn't need to use that class that much. It was only used in running the sql commands, so when I had a function that ran those commands, I didn't have any use for it.

What I learned
   I also learned from that class how to create Singletons in java! This was something I didn't know how to do, but it is actually very simple. I have a personal project that passes alot of variables from on place down into many other functions. A singleton would simplify things so immensely but I worry how much refactoring I will need to do to implement it!
